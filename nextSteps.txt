CURRENT FOCUS:
- ✓ Phase 1: Project foundation complete
- 🔄 Phase 2: Core Architecture - Domain layer complete (40%)
- Next: Data models and repository implementations

NEXT STEPS:
1. ✓ Run 'flutter pub get' to install dependencies
2. ✓ Create domain entities (Event, Ticket, User, Venue)
3. ✓ Create repository interfaces
4. Create data models with JSON serialization
5. Implement data sources (Supabase)
